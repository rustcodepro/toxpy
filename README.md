# toxpy

- streaming toxpy python interface for ToxDB
- From bioinformatics data analysis to machine and deep learning model.
- a complete package which performs the ToxDB comparison and also fits a LSTM and Convolutional Neural Network with L2 regularization

```
Usage: tox.py [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Command line interface for comparing protein sequences from GFF and FASTA
  files for ToxDB. This also includes the machine and deep learning using the
  Keras and Tensorflow and integrated LSTM and Convolution Network with L2
  Regularization.
