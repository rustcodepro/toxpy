# toxpy

- streaming toxpy python interface for ToxDB
- From bioinformatics data analysis to machine and deep learning model.
- a complete package which performs the ToxDB comparison and also fits a LSTM and Convolutional Neural Network with L2 regularization
- why i implemented L2 regulrization as PTM have the end terminal modification and hence they will reach the vanishing gradient earlier.
